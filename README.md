# how-to-joanne

## What is this repo for?
Tutorial on working with JOANNE and potential repo to carry forward the functions for a generic JOANNE++ package

## This repo contains (or is planned to contain): 

(a) notebooks that will work with JOANNE data in a tutorial format to familiarise users with the dataset
(b) notebooks that can be extended to work beyond the JOANNE dataset, for similar data from other campaigns

:warning::heavy_exclamation_mark: Requires cloning the [JOANNE repo](https://github.com/Geet-George/JOANNE) and installing in working environment :heavy_exclamation_mark::warning:

Think of this repo as a sandbox for JOANNE++

## Idea behind JOANNE++ 

A package that can be used for dropsonde processing from different field campaigns that will include:

(a) scripts to process raw data and create CF-conforming datasets
(b) scripts to create quicklooks during field operations
(c) an intake-catalog that can help access dropsonde data from across campaigns via a single access point
